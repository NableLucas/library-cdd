## Cognitive Driven Development

Inspired on [Cognitive Driven Development(CDD)](https://github.com/asouza/pilares-design-codigo/blob/master/ICSME-2020-cognitive-driven-development.pdf).

## Measurements for intrinsic complexity points

The idea is define a limit points of complexity to guide the development process based on difficulty in uderstanding

1. Contextual Coupling
2. Code branchs(if, else, switch,ternary operator(?/:),try,catch)
3. Functions as argument. Ex: ```lista.foreach(e -> e.toString());```.

The limit for class is 7 points
Why seven?
